<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong>
 and web applications.<br>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them
 into multimedia web pages.<br> HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
 for the appearance of the document.</p>

<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. 
With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page.<br>
It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, 
paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.<br> HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
